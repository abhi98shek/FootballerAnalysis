Quantitative Analysis of Footballer Performance in the English Premier League using Machine Learning Algorithms.

This dissertation analyses footballers performances based on their playing position in the English Premier League (EPL) for the 2022-2023 season. The primary metric under scrutiny for this study is the Average Match Rating. This research aims to discern the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that significantly influence this rating based on each position, while acknowledging that the determining factors of performance vary across different roles on the pitch.

To achieve the objectives, two prominent Machine Learning algorithms- Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest, were utilized. These models were trained to predict the Average Match Rating of players based on the KPIs identified earlier in the study. This subsequently generates a ranked list of players. This derived ranking from the models was compared against the original Average Overall Match Ratings rankings to gauge the efficacy of the utilized predictive models.

The study further delves into a comparative analysis of the two machine learning algorithms by evaluating their Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) for each position. This concludes that Multiple Linear Regression must be used for evaluating the Average Match Rating for Forwards and Midfielders and Defenders while Random Forest must be used to evaluate the Average Match Rating for Goalkeepers.
